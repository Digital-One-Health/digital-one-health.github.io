  headline: "**DOH hosts Fleming Legacy Review and Digital One Health Workshop in Uganda to Strengthen AMR Collaboration**

  In September 2023, the DOH lab helped to organise an Alumni Legacy Review meeting and a Digital One Health workshop in Entebbe, Uganda. Since 2019, the university has welcomed several fellows from Uganda, who have completed their fellowships with mentorship from the institution. The Fleming Fellowship Legacy workshop, led by Dr. Adrian Muwonge and supported by Bryan Wee and Tim Lee, focused on reviewing the fellows' experiences and their impact on their Beneficiary Institutions, especially concerning Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) issues. The alumni meeting aimed to strengthen ties and discuss collaborative projects and support for future fellows. The Digital One Health workshop, which included representatives from significant Ugandan health institutions, emphasized AMR surveillance data's governance and sharing. Both events underscored the value of collaboration in addressing AMR and highlighted the fellows' essential role in shaping national policies and strategies.
