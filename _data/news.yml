  headline: "**As part of the World AMR Awareness Week, the Digital One Health (DOH) group attended the antimicrobial awareness week symposium at the University of Glasgow which was co-hosted by Antimicrobial Resistance Causes and Solutions (ARCS) Consortium and the Antimicrobial and Antimicrobial Resistance (AAMR) society. Both Adrian and Kathrin Loosli from the DOH, a final year PhD student co-supervised by Dr Tiziana Lembo from Glasgow were amongst the presenters. Adrian's talk was on “The gut microbiome and microbiome dynamics at the human-livestock interface” and Kathrin's presentation was titled 'Antibiotic use in low-and-middle income country settings: Insights from East Africa'. Overall, all the talks were aimed to improve awareness and understanding of AMR and encourage best practices among the public, One Health stakeholders and policy makers, who all play a critical role in reducing the further emergence and spread of AMR.**
